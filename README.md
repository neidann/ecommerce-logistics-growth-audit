# E-commerce Growth Audit: Logistics & Customer Retention
Analyzing 100k+ Transactions to Identify Revenue Leaks

# 📊 Project Overview
This project performs a deep-dive audit of the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset (Olist). I identified key logistical bottlenecks that directly impact customer satisfaction and repeat business.

# Key Results:

* Revenue at Risk: Identified $1,615,673.74 tied to delayed deliveries.

* Retention Killer: Late deliveries (averaging 12 days) lead to a 38% drop in average       review scores.

* Efficiency: Identified that 75.65% of delays happen during the "Carrier" phase, indicating a need for logistics partner renegotiation.

#  🔍 Business Questions Answered
* How much money is being lost to shipping delays?  $1,615,673.74

* What is the "breaking point" for customer satisfaction? 38.11% of customers are unsatisfied becouse of the late deliveries

* Where is the bottleneck? 75.65% of delays happen during the "Carrier" phase

#  🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python/Pandas: Data cleaning and multi-table merging (9+ CSVs).

* Matplotlib/Seaborn: Advanced statistical visualization and outlier detection.

* NumPy: Financial calculations and time-delta processing.

#  💡 Strategic Recommendation
Based on the data, the company should implement a "Logistics Alert System" for any order that exceeds 5 days in the "Carrier" phase. By fixing the bottleneck in the carrier, the company can potentially recover 75.65% of lost 5-star reviews.
